# Angular

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Template Guidelines

This project targets Angular's modern control flow features. Legacy structural directives such as `*ngIf` and `*ngFor` are deprecated and must not be used in new code. Prefer the built-in `@if`, `@else`, `@for`, and related blocks for conditional rendering and iteration to stay aligned with the framework's recommended patterns.

## Reducing Java Boilerplate with Lombok

If you are working on the Java backend that accompanies this project, enable [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) in your IDE and use its annotations to eliminate repetitive code. Common annotations such as `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@Builder`, and `@RequiredArgsConstructor` can automatically generate accessors, builders, and constructors during compilation. This keeps your domain models and service classes focused on business logic rather than boilerplate, while preserving the clarity of the generated bytecode.

> **Note for automated contributors:** These Lombok guidelines are the canonical instructions for backend changes. When you run tooling such as GitHub Copilot, Codex, or any other automation to modify the Java services, make sure those agents also follow this section so that new code continues to use Lombok-generated boilerplate instead of hand-written accessors and constructors.

## Backend Persistence Guidelines

- Do **not** map Java enums directly to database columns. Persist their string (or other scalar) representation instead so schema migrations remain flexible.
- Always validate request payloads and derived values before persisting them to the database. Reject malformed, missing, or unsupported values early in the service layer.
